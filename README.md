# Airbnb Clone WebApp

I'm currently building an Airbnb clone app using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. Features included in the app are

- User Account creation with password authentication
- File upload with Cloudinary
- User Registration with Google and Github
- MongoDb to handle Databases, Registration and Possible listings
- Location Services
- Listing posting
- Reservation handling (Canceling reservation from both owner of booking and guest)
- Favorite component
- Loading handling
- Error handling
- Filtering components
- Interactive UI

I made use of a YouTube tutorial by [Code With Antonio](https://youtu.be/c_-b_isI4vg) as a guide and added my personal touches to it.
