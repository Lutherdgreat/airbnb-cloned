# Airbnb Clone App

I'm currently building an Airbnb clone app using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. One of the major features I'm working on is the user authentication system for secure login and registration.

I made use of a YouTube tutorial by [Clever Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrILQNl5Ed9Dz6CGMyvMTQ) as a guide and added my personal touches to it.
